### Linux GUI Architecture ###

For an introduction to the different elements of the linux GUI
(Window Mgr, Display Server, GUI etc) see

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Window_manager

also check out the Category Template at the end of the article.

* Display Server
* Window Manager
* Display Manager
	* Greeter
* Session Manager
* Desktop Manager
* Lock screen


## Display Server

The display server is that protocol that clients (i.e. applications) use to talk to the display. 
X (or X Server) is the original display server, and was designed to be run on separate nodes if required â€“ the application on one computer and the display across the network on another. More commonly now Wayland seems to be gaining ground, after a very slow start, and positions itself as a protocol for talking to a display server. The Display Servers themselves being called Wayland Compositors, and they are Compositing Window Managers, the line blurs with the next layer.

#### Wayland vs X

Under X, two separate applications help draw a window:

* the display server creates windows on the screen and gives applications a place to draw their content
* the window manager positions windows relative to each other and decorates windows with title bars and frames.

Wayland combines these two functions into a single application called the Compositor. Applications running on a Wayland system only need to talk to one endpoint.

If you want to know which you are using, see this [stack exchange](https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/325972)

## Window Manager

Although the common way to use a Window Manager is via a full Desktop Environment (including Greeter, Session and others described below), you can just use a Window Manager directly from a command boot environment. There is a [long list of X Window Managers](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Window_manager#List_of_window_managers) to choose from, if you have X in your environment. As mentioned above, a [Wayland Compositor](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Wayland#Compositors) gives you both layers, and there are plenty to choose from there too. See [this stackexchange question](https://unix.stackexchange.com/q/768524) for some specific options.

There are also some apps that can talk directly to the FrameBuffer, to display graphically 'on the prompt', such as VLC media player. Others have been written to communicate directly with X server, such as ImageMagick.

### Kiosk window manager

Taking this idea of a window manager without a desktop environment, you could also use this for a kiosk approach (see [kiosk in MugammaPi](https://github.com/artmg/MuGammaPi/wiki/Kiosk)). [Cage](https://www.hjdskes.nl/projects/cage/) is one such project, and although it falls into the category of 'Wayland compositor', it is merely a window manager and is not expected to do any compositing :)

## Display Manager

 starts the X servers, user sessions and greeter (login screen)

* LightDM
	* default in and Lubuntu & Ubuntu
	* see https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LightDM
* SDDM
	* preferred by Lxqt / Lubuntu Next

You can see what X sessions and Wayland sessions are available to a desktop manager by viewing the contents of `/usr/share/xsessions/`  and `/usr/share/wayland-sessions/` folders.

ArchLinux has a good article on [display managers](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Display_manager)

### frame buffer

The Linux framebuffer (fbdev) is a graphic hardware-independent 
abstraction layer to show graphics on a computer monitor. 

The framebuffer can be used to:

* implement text Linux console that is richer than _hardware text mode_, and allows graphical elements or more flexible use of character formats
* give a hardware/driver-independent graphic output method for a display server
* allow graphical program to display without the heavy overhead of X Window

Examples of the third application include Linux programs such as MPlayer, links2, Netsurf, fbida,[2] and fim [3] and libraries such as GGI, SDL, GTK+, and Qt, which can all use the framebuffer directly. 

#### Remote Frame Buffer protocol

RFB is the technique that is used to send images from the frame buffer over the network to view the screen from a different computer. This is used by the VNC virtual network clients. See [Remote Desktop](https://github.com/artmg/MuGammaPi/wikiRemote-Desktop) for more about VNC servers and clients.  
## Policy Kit

The freedesktop.org Policy Kit was introduced for authorising actions on the desktop to specific users or groups, although it has actually been adopted and extended to more fundamental aspects of the operating system. For instance even Raspberry Pi OS Lite [uses it](https://forum.openmediavault.org/index.php?thread/41757-polkit-s-pkexec-component-identified-as-cve-2021-4034-pwnkit/&postID=299687#post299687) to allow non-privileged users to elevate privileges to reboot. And of course it is this ability that exploits like 'pwnkit' leverage.

Now known simply as 'polkit', [the project source]() describes itself as 'a toolkit for defining and handling authorizations, used for allowing unprivileged processes to speak to privileged processes'. The polkit package (depends on the polkitd daemon and the pkexec utility as a setuid tool, but will only raise privilege if policy rules are met. 

The permlink to the most up to date manuals is https://www.freedesktop.org/software/polkit/docs/latest/ where you can also find a [polkit system architecural overview](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/polkit/docs/latest/polkit.8.html). 

e.g. 
* Allow all users to add wifi connections
* "Authentication is required to unlock the encrypted device"

* http://www.freedesktop.org/software/polkit/docs/latest/polkit.8.html
 * Actions are defined by applications
 * Rules are how Sys Admins control authorisation
 * also corroborated by https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Polkit
 * which suggests the javascript .rules files go under
 * /usr/share/polkit-1/rules.d   for third parties and
 * /etc/polkit-1/rules.d   for local configuration

#### Polkit version history

In the upstream version 106, [the developer chose](`http://davidz25.blogspot.com/2012/06/authorization-rules-in-polkit.html`) to switch the local authority backend to use javascript. For [historical reasons](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=946231#10) the Debian downstream project begin manually applying virtually every change except that change, in order to keep the old **.pkla** and **.conf** files. Whereas many other distros stuck with the upstream and switched to re-defining policies in Javascript **.rules** files.

This parial forking, since around 2012, has caused a lack of correlation between upstream project version numbers where features and bugfixes have been introduced, and the Debian downstream package. For instance 0.105.20, delivered in Ubuntu 18.04 LTS, was around v115 upstream. The best way to cross-relate the versions is with [the debian package maintainer's changelog](https://salsa.debian.org/utopia-team/polkit/-/blob/master/debian/changelog)

Since 0.105.26 Debian maintainers have been stepping towards using the current upstream release, and patching in the old localauthority backend, as an alternative to the JavaScript backend. This appears to be in the form of polkitd-pkla

### Legacy PKLA backend

* [Debian PolicyKit docs](https://wiki.debian.org/PolicyKit)
	* clarifies that still uses .pkla and .conf not .rules javascript
	* recommends [pklocalauthority(8) man page](https://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/jammy/en/man8/pklocalauthority.8.html) for configuration help
* [Historical 105 PKLA doc](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/polkit/docs/0.105/pklocalauthority.8.html)
* Legacy system architecture from [polkit(8) man page](https://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/jammy/en/man8/polkit.8.html#system%20architecture)

`man pklocalauthority` describes the tree including `/etc/polkit-1/localauthority` sub folders such as 30-site.d and 50-local.d which are useful scopes but these are all .conf files


### upstream JavaScript backend

### diagnostics

```
pkaction --version
```

* pkcheck will only see in an existing process is running would be authorised
* try looking at server logs (journalctl)
