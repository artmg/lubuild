Network Appliance Firmware
--------------------------

Although general purpose computer hardware gives you more flexibility, 
you may be better off with simpler, more efficient solutions 
using "appliances", especially for networked services. 

The more limited but dedicated software can run well 
even on low powered hardware, and is often suited to limited memory 
capacity, or flash storage.

# Appliance 'firmware' options

## Network Appliances

### Dedicated distros ###

#### work on ARM or embedded ####

* OpenWrt
    * embedded system that can be flashed onto wide range of consumer devices
    * Pi is supported, but the distro is compiled for **armel** (no hardware maths acceleration) so it runs slower than some hardware of similar power [http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/raspberry_pi_foundation/raspberry_pi]
    * mainly aimed at wireless and combo routers - compare
        * routers (no modem, no wireless) - [http://skinflint.co.uk/?cat=router]
        * with the [OpenWrt hardware list](http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/start)
        * wlan router modems that support OpenWrt [http://skinflint.co.uk/?cat=wlanroutmod&xf=758_OpenWrt&sort=p]
        * wlan routers (no modem) that support OpenWrt [http://skinflint.co.uk/?cat=wlanrout&xf=758_OpenWrt&sort=p]
* DD-WRT
    *
* Tomato
    * 
* Alpine (ARMhf)
    *
* IPFire 
    * no support for Pi2, poor for ARM
    * better on Intel / AMD chipset
    * see [hardware requirements](http://wiki.ipfire.org/en/hardware/start)


#### Need Intel / AMD ####

* m0n0wall
    * very lightweight
* pfSense
    * FOSS for the appliances they sell, but they offer a **Community Edition**
    * requires Intel or AMD - x86 or x64
    * has full install to SDD / HDD or NanoBSD version to run from flash (see [downloads](https://www.pfsense.org/download/))
    * Includes firewall, router, DHCP server, gateway, OpenVPN, IPsec, proxy and anti-virus (Snort)
* ZeroShell
* NST
* PacketFence
    * network access control (NAC) solution: captive-portal for registration, centralized wired and wireless management, powerful BYOD management options, 802.1X support, layer-2 isolation of problematic devices.

# Some hardware options

Of course the good old Raspberry Pi has a lot of flexibility 
with a low price tag. You can overcome the limitation of the single 
ethernet port by adding another one via USB, but you may still find 
throughput limited for the most bandwidth intensive application, 
especially if it's an edge device that many devices share. 

## reuse with OpenWrt

many 'dedicated' network appliances, like routers and gateways, 
can be given a new lease of life by flashing them with OpenWrt. 
See the firmware section below for ideas and links

## netboards

* ALIX or APU1 based 
    * e.g. [https://www.applianceshop.eu/parts/pcengines.html]

## alternative low power SBCs

* https://www.newit.co.uk/shop/




# OpenWrt

OpenWrt is a great alternative firmware for network appliances you may have bought, 
including routers, as it allows you to configure them just how you want, 
and utilise all the hardware capabilities they may physically possess. 

NB: This page does NOT include the per-device stuff about how to get the image on there in the first place!


## Prepare

```
# to establish an IP connection use procedures above - configure/network-interface.md 

# then test
ping 192.168.1.1
```

## Start

### first login

```
# credit - https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/firstlogin
telnet 192.168.1.1

# set your new password
passwd

# now switch modes
exit

ssh root@192.168.1.1
```

### firmware backups

Use [https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/generic.backup] to create **art** and **boot** backups

Then use the line snippets to create the full MTD backups, before zipping them with

 tar -cz -f /tmp/mtds.backup.tar.gz /tmp/mtd*.backup

Now, from another terminal,  

 # copy the files to the local working folder using scp
 scp root@192.168.1.1:/tmp/art.backup .
 scp root@192.168.1.1:/tmp/boot.backup .
 scp root@192.168.1.1:/tmp/mtds.backup.tar.gz .
 # check they arrived ok
 ls -l

Back on the router, check that tmp is not too close to 100% full. 
If it is then use **reboot** to clear it out automatically.


## Dumb AP

Use the [recipe for a Dumb AP](https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/dumbap), 
no routing, simply switching all traffic through...

```
# back up the old versions
cp /etc/config/network  /etc/config/network.backup.`date +%y%m%d`
cp /etc/config/firewall /etc/config/firewall.backup.`date +%y%m%d`
cp /etc/config/dhcp     /etc/config/dhcp.backup.`date +%y%m%d`
cp /etc/rc.local        /etc/rc.local.`date +%y%m%d`

### DISABLE DHCP
# do this via luci interface of...
#uci set dhcp.lan.ignore=1
uci set dhcp.lan.ignore='1'
uci commit dhcp
# leave dnsmasq in case we need TFTP
/etc/init.d/dnsmasq restart
# or if not required could just delete /etc/rc.d/S60dnsmasq
# or 
# /etc/init.d/dnsmasq disable
# /etc/init.d/dnsmasq stop

### ALLOW ALL TRAFFIC
# for now to configure to pass ALL using firewall ACCEPT
# alternatively disable firewall
#/etc/init.d/firewall disable
#/etc/init.d/firewall stop
cat > /etc/config/firewall <<EOF
config defaults
    option syn_flood   1
    option input       ACCEPT
    option output      ACCEPT
    option forward     REJECT

config zone
    option name        lan
    list   network     'lan'
    option input       ACCEPT
    option output      ACCEPT
    option forward     ACCEPT
EOF

### ALLOW Multicast Forwarding
# no need to escape quotes and slashes when using cat redirect
cat >>/etc/rc.local <<EOF
echo "0" > /sys/devices/virtual/net/br-lan/bridge/multicast_snooping
EOF

### Set AP Hostname
# alternatively you can set this in the file /etc/config/network under the proper interface add:
#         option hostname 'hostname_you_want'
# this uses uci:
# NEW_HOST=hostname_you_want
uci set network.lan.hostname=$NEW_HOST
uci set system.@system[0].hostname=$NEW_HOST

### use DHCP for lan
uci set network.lan.proto=dhcp
# do we also have to remove the options ipaddr / netmask ??
# in case of issues edit the config file instead


# save the changes
uci commit system
uci commit network

### Avahi service advertising
# credit https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/zeroconf
# you MUST to be be a live network to do this
opkg update
# IF Config Avahi Advertising includes SSH 
opkg install avahi-daemon-service-ssh
# IF Config Avahi Advertising includes HTTP
opkg install avahi-daemon-service-http

### Apply changes
/etc/init.d/network reload

# you will now most likely loose connectivity to that session
```

### Set up WIFI

* curently done via interface
* set to use uci, driven with variables

* https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/wireless

## Back up

Using the LUCI web console, or the [manual ssh & scp instructions](https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/generic.backup#backup_openwrt_configuration), grab yourself a safe copy of the configs


## Troubleshooting

```

### Logs

#### Kernel Log
dmesg

#### System log
logread
# help - https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/log.essentials

#### Send logs to server

# set up destination server for system logs
# help - https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/system
uci set system.@system[0].log_ip=192.168.1.x
uci set system.@system[0].log_port=
# save the changes
uci commit system


### Networking
# if you need to refresh the dhcp lease ....
udhcpc
cat /var/dhcp.leases
cat /var/resolv.conf
cat /var/resolv.conf.auto


```

### diagnosing wifi connections

The OpenWrt GUI page Network / Wireless includes 
MAC addresses, signal strength and TX RX rates. 
This is not so simple to refer to when you have 
multiple APs and no hostnames in the list. 

Check the following article for ideas 
on how to combine this data from multiple sources 
and look up MAC addresses against a table.

https://medium.com/openwrt-iot/openwrt-debugging-your-wireless-fac83a6fdc44

see also:

* https://openwrt.org/docs/guide-developer/debugging#wireless
* https://openwrt.org/docs/guide-user/network/wifi/wireless.overview#packages
* 

### Failsafe mode

If you really screw up the configuration, and have trouble accessing the device at all, then see the failsafe mode

 [https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/generic.failsafe]

and check [Procedures for Configuring Network Interface](https://github.com/artmg/lubuild/blob/master/help/configure/network-interface.md) to set an address in the 192.168.1.x network


# pfSense

pfSense was a fork from m0n0wall that has since become sponsored by Netgate, Teaxs (not to be confused with Netgear). It is unclear when, but inferring from the blogs it was likely between 2008 and 2012. They have maintained it with an Open Source license, albeit with some license changes. In 2018 it is undergoing some major re-architecting for a version 3. In 2014 there was a fork by developers sponsored by Deciso BV, Rotterdam. Since then much of OPNsense has been re-written, and there has been animosity between the corresponding sponsors.  


## pfsense on nanobsd

From psSense v2.4 nanobsd is no longer supported.


### nanoBSD background and architecture

NanoBSD is basically the FreeBSD functionality and package set 
super-optimised for embedded purposes ('Appliances') 
by running it ReadOnly (as if using a Live USB image) 
which really suits a) flash media storage, and 
b) smooth restart after a power outage


* two code partitions
    * _.disk.full NanoBSD images contain whole disk (3 parts)
    * _.disk.image contains only a single code partititon
* single cfg partition
    * persistent config files to copy over /etc at boot up
    * see [how to persist changes BACK into cfg](https://www.freebsd.org/doc/en/articles/nanobsd/howto.html)
* 

[https://doc.pfsense.org/index.php/Full_Install_and_NanoBSD_Comparison]

* disk left in RO mode to prolong shelf-life
* _RRD_ (usage) graph data, DHCP leases, etc are transient
* console reboot will back up these transient files to restore them when you restart
* Log files are NOT persisted across reboot
* Not really made for expanding partition across media ('a la Pi)
    * [forumQ on expanding](https://forum.pfsense.org/index.php?topic=61434.0)
* running out of space is usually about improper configuration (or specification)
    * [https://forum.pfsense.org/index.php?topic=59474.0]
* 

If you received an embedded device that preshipped with pfsense, 
but only on a 2GB SD card, you could use an 8GB card instead, 
and on the next (upgrade/) install the use 4GB image. For help see:

* [one post about manual install](https://forum.pfsense.org/index.php?topic=75427.0)
* [step by step on installing pfsense onto generic APU device](http://www.yawarra.com.au/tutorials/how-to-install-pfsense-on-an-apu/).


Alternative is to [Full Install to flash](http://gegonotes.com/installing-pfsense/), 
which risks wearing the media and suffering filesystem corruptions.

See some misc command examples for disk manipulation 
[here](https://www.freebsd.org/doc/handbook/disks-adding.html), 
[here](https://www.freebsd.org/doc/handbook/usb-disks.html) and 
[here](http://bsdrp.net/documentation/technical_docs).


## pfsense general

from ssh shell...

```
# install 

```

### Security requirements

Some circumstances recommend renaming administrative logins. 
With pfSense you need to bear in mind:
* you cannot rename the WebAdmin user, but need to create a new one
    * https://forum.pfsense.org/index.php?topic=59119.0
* the authentication and authorisation for SSH access may be separate from the web admins
    * https://forum.pfsense.org/index.php?topic=135478.0



## pfSense Services

### VLANs

If your network includes subnetworks, 
you need to define these in 

* Interfaces / (assign) / VLANs
* Add
* Parent Interface: LAN (re2 ?)
* VLAN tag: 
* VLAN priority: 
* Description: 



### DHCP and DHCPv6

For simplicity you could enable DHCP Server for your network from the pfSense box.

DHCP v4 is relatively straightforward.
You may assign a Static IPv4 address on the WAN Interface, or if the modem offers you could use DHCP. You should assign a static IPv4 address on the LAN interface.


Before enabling DHCPv6 Server, you should 
enable the DHCPv6 client on the WAN interface. 

* Interfaces / WAN / General section
* IPv6 Configuration Type: DHCP6
* DHCP6 Client Configuration section
* Use IPv4 as parent: CHECK (assuming you have not yet configured your gateway to allow IPv6)
* Only Request IPv6 prefix: CHECK
* Prefix Delegation Size: 

This should be according to your network design. For simplicity, you can keep a single subnet and choose 64. If you want up to 256 subnets, choose 56. And if you have a large network and want to extend up to ,000s of subnets, choose 48.

* Send a Prefix hint: CHECK
* 

* Interfaces / LAN / General section
* IPv6 Configuration Type: Track Interface
* Track IPv6 Interface section
* IPv6 Interface: WAN
* IPv6 Prefix ID: (use hex equivalent of your subnet 3rd octet in IPv4 Static address) 
* Do not allow PD/Address release: ?

NB: if you do not release, but you change your prefix size then you may need to delete the DUID file (/var/db/dhcp6c_duid) via the CLI. This option was previously called DUID hold.

NB: If you are reusing an ISP router as a gateway modem only, then you should prevent it from requesting IPv6 Routing Prefix, as it is likely to only ask for /64. Alternatively set the modem into bridged mode, rather than routing mode. The option "Do not wait for a RA" may also help with certain issues between ISPs and their gateway settings.

If you can't manage to get IPv6 working via your ISP, you can still use a free [Tunnel Broker](https://tunnelbroker.net/) to a local IPv6 over IPv4 tunnel server - see [pfSense config guide](https://www.netgate.com/docs/pfsense/interfaces/using-ipv6-with-a-tunnel-broker.html).

Once you have done your first IPv6 ping 
you may like to try out 
https://ipv6.he.net/certification/
for a little more geeky 'fun'.

/64 range is `:: to ::ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff`


### DNS

* Enable ('Unbound') DNS Resolver
* (listen on) Network Interface: LAN and localhost
* Outgoing: WAN
* Forwarding Mode: Y 
* DHCP Registration: Leases AND Static
* help - [https://doc.pfsense.org/index.php/Unbound_DNS_Resolver]

### Avahi

```
# packages are case sensitive
pfSsh.php playback installpkg "Avahi"
```

### Modem Access

- modem has internal interface on .1. network available so can be connected

### Snort IDS/IPS

* Installation
    * [register account to get Oinkcode](http://hubpages.com/technology/How-to-Set-Up-an-Intrusion-Detection-System-Using-Snort-on-pfSense-20)
    * [Then setup Snort](https://doc.pfsense.org/index.php/Setup_Snort_Package)
        * Interfaces: WAN
        * for other settings see [Config.md]
* Operation
    * to Check Logs
        * 
    * to **disable rules** rather than using _suppression lists_
        * see comments in [OLD simple procs](https://forum.pfsense.org/index.php?topic=61018.0)
        * See Setup Snort Package above for how to disable rules

### SMTP messages

* Create new gmail account with 2 step authentication to allow App Specific pwds
* Add App Specific password - Custom - SMTP sender
* Use [Gmail SMTP server](https://support.google.com/a/answer/176600?hl=en)
    * SMTP server (not relay)
    * SSL or TLS to allow send to anyone
* System / Advanced / Notifications / SMTP E-Mail
    * E-Mail server: smtp.gmail.com
    * SMTP Port of E-Mail server: 465
    * Secure SMTP Connection: Enable SMTP over SSL/TLS
    * Addresses - 

define the addresses according to your Config


### Certificates

Alternatives:

* Certificates from LetsEncrypt ?
	- free to obtain Domain Validation certs
	- should be trusted out of the box by most systems
	- uses ACME process
    * see current progress of pfsense package [https://redmine.pfsense.org/issues/5434]
* Generating device certificates from Signing Requests (CSR)
	- this didn't have the answer [https://forum.pfsense.org/index.php?topic=70122.0]
	- but this explains how to use the command line [http://www.schie.com/certificates-and-pfsense-how-to-sign-cert-requests/]

Procedures:

* Generate new CA
    * System / Cert Manager / CAs
    * New / create Internal CA
        * Key length: 4096 / Algorithm: SHA512
            * using high settings: CA key will NOT affect effort to encrypt traffic
        * Lifetime: 730
            * Choosing low value as assuming CA will be easy to replace :D

* Generate certificate for firewall box
    * Certificates / Add / Create Internal
        * Name: 

define the Certificate Name according to your Config

* .
	* .
        * Key: 2048 / Algo: SHA256 (defaults)
        * Lifetime: 730
        * Common Name: (use FQDN from System / General)
        * (rest as default)
    * System / Advanced / Admin
        * SSL Cert: choosen Name above
        * Save
    * System / Cert Manager / Certificates 
        * delete old webConfigurator default certificate

* To generate new certificates for other devices
	* System Cert Manager / Certificates / Add 
		- Method: Create an internal certificate
		- Descriptive name: My nicely description name
		- Certificate Type: Server Certificate
		- Common Name: hostname
		- Alternative Names: FQDN - hostname.fully.qualified.dm
		- Save
		- Export P12
		- Export Key but STORE SECURELY!

### Firewall

To add your rules based on a scripted config file, see [https://www.netgate.com/docs/pfsense/firewall/adding-rules-with-easyrule.html]


### Proxy

Alternatives:

* Squid rather than simply OpenDNS + block external DNS resolvers
* [https://doc.pfsense.org/index.php/Setup_Squid_as_a_Transparent_Proxy]
* Squid3 (proxy) - YES
    * Interface: LAN
    * Transparent (redirect :80)
    * local cache (depending on storage available) ?
    * MITM ? e.g. Peek And Splice (replaces SslBump)
    * Logging ?
* SquidGuard3 (access control) - YES
    * blacklist: e.g.
        * shallalist.de
        * 
    * how to authenticate users - for reporting and elevation
    * e.g. based on MAC and (optionally) local logged-on username
        * pfsense natively supports LDAP & Radius
        * see [http://wiki.squid-cache.org/Features/Authentication]
        * [basic passwords from ncsa_auth](http://www.squidguard.org/Doc/authentication.html)

* ? HAVP - virus scan downloads (e.g. max 1 MB) ?
    * e.g. SquidClamAV (via ICAP)
* ? DansGuardian ? web content filtering
    * 

### bandwidth monitoring

* for information on options 
	* see [https://doc.pfsense.org/index.php/How_can_I_monitor_bandwidth_usage]
* BandwidthD
	- deprecating as upstream has no dev
	- shows simple but useful graphs
	- break down by local device 
* ntopng
	- recommended instead of BandwidthD
	- may be more complex
	- not ideal for low memory / cpu systems
* vnstat
	- used by new(ish) Status Traffic Totals package
* netflow
	- uses softflowd package
	- relies on separate 'collector' node on network
	- more complex to set up but seems well liked
* logstash
	- remote collection
	- combined with ELK for interpretation
	- NOT a simple setup, see below

### Logs

It is often better to store logs remotely, whether they are for 
security, performance, or other kinds of monitoring. 
Most embedded systems are not designed for log storage, either 
they have small memory capacity, or the disks are flash and are not 
suited to constant writing and overwriting. 
Also they may not have the RAM or CPU capacity to do anything with data, 
other than to simply ship it elsewhere, for storage and further processing. 

* Remote Logging
    * Status / System Logs / Settings
    * Enable Remote Logging: check
    * Server 1: _see Syslog Server in Config_
    * Remote Syslog Contents: Everything
    * Save
* Log Analysis
    * for filter to interpret pfsense logs with ELK see [https://elijahpaul.co.uk/monitoring-pfsense-2-1-logs-using-elk-logstash-kibana-elasticsearch/] 
 
For configuring and using the remote collection service, 
see [https://github.com/artmg/lubuild/blob/master/help/configure/Networked-Services.md]

#### ELK

A suggested method:
* set up an ELK stack remote logging server
* add Softflowd on pfsense to feed netflow packet data 
* the (remote) logstash server inserts into ElasticSearch
* build a simple Kibana dashboard to track per-device usage, all usage, down vs. up, v4 vs v6, etc.

Other suggestions:
* install dnsmasq on the remote to cache dns lookups locally 
	- reduces pfsense traffic, CPU and risk of crash
* logstash filter only doing ip -> FQDN translations for IPv4 fields that match my internal LAN
* tell Kibana that the netflow.in_bytes field was measured in bytes
	- so that it would automatically convert to KB/MB/GB
* custom index template so that my FQDN fields weren't analyzed
* set up some graphs and tables to see total and individual usage
	-(traffic from pfsense router to an internal machine == downloads, 
	- and traffic from internal machines to my pfsense router == uploads)


## troubleshooting

For general help see [https://doc.pfsense.org/]

If _Saving Settings are slow_ [sic] on NanoBSD it may be due to pfsense bug:

* Diagnostics / NanoBSD
* Media = Read / Write (NOT RO)
* Permanent = check (keep media mounted RW always) and Save

If modem is inaccessible:

* see [pfsense Modem Access](https://doc.pfsense.org/index.php/Accessing_modem_from_inside_firewall)
* set up OPT2 on re1 .1.5/24 with NAT 

For capturing packets, use the [Diagnostics / Packet Capture feature](https://doc.pfsense.org/index.php/Sniffers,_Packet_Capture).


### Unbound DNS Resolver

Under Services / DNS Resolver / Advanced are

* Log level verbosity
    * to see logs: Status / System Logs / System / DNS Resolver

* Help
    * [https://doc.pfsense.org/index.php/Unbound_DNS_Resolver]
    * [https://unbound.net/]


#### CNAMES for aliases 

* Unbound does NOT fully support CNAMES - even though you can enter them into advanced options, the service is NOT authoritative so clients are unlikely to resolve them [https://www.bentasker.co.uk/documentation/linux/279-unbound-adding-custom-dns-records]
* The recomendation for CNAME support is to use BIND or NSD although these also have limitations [https://forums.freebsd.org/threads/unbound-resolver-or-server.49131/]
* In theory you could would put another DNS service onto a different local port and create a stub zone within Unbound, but Dnsmasq (DNS Resolver) does not really support CNAMES either [https://forum.pfsense.org/index.php?topic=78356.0]
* DNS Resolver Edit Hosts feature allows a kind of alias, but you still need to manually enter an IP. This means double-updating with DHCP leases, defying the whole point! [https://forum.pfsense.org/index.php?topic=98423.0]
* [https://redmine.pfsense.org/issues/2410]
* At the end of the day the simplest route to rename a device which does not supply its own hostname is to put the hostname you want on the DHCP lease and accept that the address will be static
