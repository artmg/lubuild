## Introduction 

Samba is a Server Message Blocks (SMB) server, 
to share files and printers across a network, 
in a way that Windows PCs can access easily.

Because SMB is the default way for Windows to share files, 
it is commonly used as a cross-platform solution from Linux servers 
(rather than just using the NFS Network File System that only Unix understands). 
Samba runs a daemon listening at port 445 that uses SMB. 
An early version of was known as CIFS, the Common Internet File System, but Microsoft replaced this with newer improved versions of SMB 2 or 3. 
See more info at [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Message_Block]

The Samba config file may also turn on WINS, 
the Windows Internet Naming Service, 
so that computer names are broadcast and can be used instead of IP addresses.

### how to configure

* install
* create master conf
* testparm to copy to main conf

Although you may directly edit the configuration file **/etc/samba/smb.conf** the recommended process above ensures you are warned of any configuration errors. 


### setting up SAMBA

```
# install samba
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y samba
# ensure install samba-common-bin is installed for testparm to work

# back up original
sudo cp /etc/samba/smb.conf /etc/samba/smb.conf.original
# save as master
sudo cp /etc/samba/smb.conf /etc/samba/smb.conf.master
# edit master file
sudo gnome-text-editor /etc/samba/smb.conf.master
# or just editor if you have no gui

# data stored under /srv/samba (following Filesystem Hierarchy Standard)
set SHARES_ROOT=/srv/samba/MySharedFolder

# create standard location for samba data (unless you plan to use a mounted device)
sudo mkdir -p $SHARES_ROOT

#### Sample shares
# unauthenticated access to a share
cat <<EOF | sudo tee /etc/samba/smb.conf.master 
[MyShare]
   path = $SHARES_ROOT
EOF

# help - https://www.samba.org/samba/docs/man/manpages/smb.conf.5.html


# test the master file and create real conf file
testparm -s /etc/samba/smb.conf.master && testparm -s /etc/samba/smb.conf.master | sudo tee /etc/samba/smb.conf
# credit - http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1462926
# NB only valid option lines that differ from the default will appear in the testparm output

### Restart services with new config ###
sudo /etc/init.d/samba restart
## OR alternatively
# sudo smbd reload
# sudo service smbd restart


# if you need any tweaks then repeat
sudo editor /etc/samba/smb.conf.master 

```


### advertising shares with Avahi

for basics on avahi ...
* please see [https://github.com/artmg/lubuild/blob/master/help/configure/Networked-Services.md]

The following configuration directive is YES by default ...

```
[global]
    multicast dns register = yes      # register itself with mDNS services like Avahi
```




## Client Access to Samba shares

### Access them from Linux ###

* for issues with Autodiscovery (including local Name Resolution) using mDNS:
   * see _Autodiscovery_ above for server-side issues
   * for client-side issues see [https://github.com/artmg/lubuild/blob/master/help/configure/Networked-Services.md]

```
### GUI Access
# help - https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Lubuntu/PCManFM#Browse_Windows_PCs_with_Samba

### CLI Access
# allow mounting samba / CIFS
sudo apt-get install -y cifs-utils

### prepare mount
LOCAL_MOUNT=mylocalmount
MOUNT_SHARE=//otherpc.local/sharename
MOUNT_OPTIONS="-o -ro"

#MOUNT_LOCAL=/media/mylocalmount
MOUNT_ROOT=/media
sudo mkdir -p $MOUNT_ROOT/$LOCAL_MOUNT
sudo mount -t cifs --verbose $MOUNT_OPTIONS $MOUNT_SHARE $MOUNT_ROOT/$LOCAL_MOUNT

# sync contents
# NB this is TEST ONLY MODE with dry run
rsync --dry-run -av --modify-window=3605 $MOUNT_ROOT/$LOCAL_MOUNT /media/localdrive/localcopy/ 
```

### Access Samba from Macos

Tested with High Sierra. 
SMB client is already installed by default. 

```
MOUNT_SHARE=//otherpc.local/sharename
MOUNT_PERM=no

/usr/bin/osascript -e "try" -e "mount volume \"smb:$MOUNT_SHARE\"" -e "end try"
```

The following alternative doesn't work yet

```
LOCAL_MOUNT=mylocalmount
MOUNT_SHARE=//otherpc.local/sharename
MOUNT_OPTIONS="-o -f=777,-d=0777"
MOUNT_PERM=no

# couldn't manage to work out how to get the permissions inside right with the following
MOUNT_OPTIONS="-o noowners"
MOUNT_OPTIONS="-o -f=777,-d=0777"
MOUNT_OPTIONS="-o -m=777"

MOUNT_ROOT=/Volumes
sudo umount $MOUNT_ROOT/$LOCAL_MOUNT
sudo mkdir -p $MOUNT_ROOT/$LOCAL_MOUNT
sudo chmod 777 $MOUNT_ROOT/$LOCAL_MOUNT 
sudo mount -v $MOUNT_OPTIONS -t smbfs $MOUNT_SHARE $MOUNT_ROOT/$LOCAL_MOUNT
``` 

### Troubleshooting ####

#### Windows access issues

* Device not showing in Windows browse lists
    * From device running Samba try

```
smbclient -L localhost
```

 * Does the Workgroup setting on the clients match Samba config Workgroup?
 * Does NMB service need to be running too?
 * In some cases you may need to modify settings on the Windows client, e.g.
     * Network and Sharing Center / Advanced sharing settings (on left-hand pane)
         * All Networks / File sharing connections / **check** Enable file sharing for 40 & 56 bit encryption
     * Network Connections / (right-click network adapter) / Properties / 
     * Internet Protocol Version 4 / Advanced... / WINS / Enable NetBios over TCP/IP = TRUE
     * Check the firewall allows traffic on the specific network including "File and Printer Sharing (LLMNR-UDP-In)"
     * flush caches for DNS / NetBIOS / ARP from **Admin** command prompt with

```
ipconfig /flushdns & nbtstat -R & arp -d *
```

#### Other Troubleshooting ###

If you cannot see the server or share under "Windows Network" then check smb.conf 
to ensure you have set
```
Workgroup = WORKGROUP
```
at least in the global section (and you could even try adding it against the share for testing)

other settings that may help include
```
local master = yes
preferred master = yes
wins support = yes

multicast dns register = yes      # register itself with mDNS services like Avahi
```

#### issues with linux samba client

##### browsing

If you cannot browse samba servers on the network via a linux client such as ubuntu
edit the following file on the client /etc/samba/smb.conf

```
# add this in global to use broadcast FIRST
name resolve order = bcast host

service samba restart
```

##### authentication and authorisation

ensure that you have defined:
* the correct user credentials when you mount the cifs share
    * see section **XXXXXX** above 
* the correct back-end a) user/group and b) file and directory mode on the share and c) the corresponding user/group/mode on the filesystem
    * 

If you simply want to use your local password database then use these options 

```
[global]
	# authenticate per-user rather than per-share
	security = user
	# use the local /etc/passwd and shadow files
	passdb backend = plaintext
```

There are more complex ways to set this up, where there is a local 
set of smaba users and passwords kept in sync with the local linux 
users and passwords using pam_smbpass, but the method above is simpler.
