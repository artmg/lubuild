# Diagnose Disks

## General Troubleshooting


The '''gnome-disks''' utility is a handy GUI for many simple diagnostics.

If you are having trouble with an installed system, 
see **boot-repair** for a powerful GUI designed to get it working again

The rest of this section introduces useful commands for understanding 
disks and other storage devices.


### Terminal navigation

If you are connecting to a remote device via SSH shell 
then you will not be able to use a GUI program, 
however `curses` utilities allow a terminal user interface instead. 

* ncdu
	* focussed on disk space used
	* already installed in some distros
	* quickly browse the used space in a folder tree
* mc - midnight commander
	* navigate folders and view files
	* lightweight to install the `mc` package
	* similar two-blue-panel look to DOS commercial file 'commanders'
* cfdisk
	* interactive partition table editor
	* already installed in some distros
	* run with `sudo`


## Discover the attached devices

```
# see which partitions are currently in use and check how full
df
# if you prefer 'human readable' gigs and megs 
df -H

# view details of disk partitioning
sudo fdisk -l

# show all devices whether or not mounted
lsblk

# by disk (partition) Label, show mounted devices
ls -l /dev/disk/by-label/
# and all devices
lsblk -o name,fstype,mountpoint,label,size

# for super detailed information, as well as listing column names above
lsblk -JO # Json output of all cOlumns
# or you might find this more readable for USB devices
sudo lsusb -v
# there are additional commands like lshw or hdparm but the above are usually installed
```

### unmounted filesystems

If you have errors on the filesystem, it might not have been mounted â€“ check with `dmesg` to see quickly.

```
# identify the FS type
sudo fdisk -l /dev/sdx

# see what fsck types you have available
ls /sbin/fsck*

# do a dummy check, e.g.
sudo fsck.FSTYPE -N /dev/sdxN
# -n for fat

```

Then you can try the fsck for real - see below. 

If you cannot recover the filesystem, then try testdisk

```
sudo apt install testdisk
sudo testdisk
```

or move on to [Disk recovery and forensics](https://github.com/artmg/lubuild/blob/master/help/diagnose/disk-recovery-and-forensics.md)

NOTE: if your data is high value, then consider
creating an image before any changes that might make
files harder to recover


## Simple checks

```
# provided the filesystem is UNMOUNTED, check it
sudo umount /dev/sdbX
sudo fsck -t ext4 /dev/sdbX 

# sudo badblocks /dev/sdbX
```
If you need to do full check on a filesystem that is in use, 
reboot to a Live USB so they are not mounted.

## Capacity - disk full?

```
# check available space on mounted disks
df -H

# check the first level folders
du --max-depth=1 -ah
# sort it
du --max-depth=1 -a | sort -nr
# human readable sort
du --max-depth=1 -ah | sort -hr | head
```

### Specifics to clean up 

```
### Clean up root ###

## local package cache ##
# display cache size
du -sh /var/cache/apt/archives
# credit - http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/28502/
# purge
sudo apt-get clean


## crash logs ##
# display cache size
du -sh /var/log
# purge
sudo rm -fR /var/log/*


## If you delete large files but they are still in use 
# in process handles the space cannot be freed
# until you flush one of these handles - 
# credit - http://unix.stackexchange.com/a/64737
lsof | grep deleted | grep MyBigFile
# pick one of the pids and check its handles
ls -l /proc/<Pid>/fd
# flush the relevant handle by sending it 'nothing' 
> /proc/<Pid>/fd/<HandleId>


## old kernels ##
# purge
sudo apt-get update         # re-read package repositories
sudo dpkg --configure -a    # complete any installations previously aborted 
sudo apt-get -f install     # sort out packages not correctly installed due to space issues 
sudo apt-get -y autoremove  # remove any items no longer required, including kernels
sudo apt-get clean          # re-purge cache for any items just downloaded


# re-check available space on mounted disks
df -H

# if you still think you can reclaim more, try bleach bit system cleaner
sudo apt-get install bleachbit
# as well as locations above, it also checks locations for well-known apps (like browser caches)

```

## Specific disk configurations

### USB removable drives

If you want to watch what happens when you 
plug or unplug a drive then try

```
udevadm monitor -u --environment
```


### ISOs

```
# If you have an ISO image and want to know if it is bootable...
# display the disk label and whether the Bootable flag is set
file MyImage.ISO
# for much more comprehensive info
isoinfo -d -i MyImage.ISO
# credit [http://askubuntu.com/a/31903]
```

### Swap

```
# Is swap encrypted?
#
sudo blkid | grep swap
#
# e.g. 
# /dev/mapper/cryptswap1: UUID="95f3d64d-6c46-411f-92f7-867e92991fd0" TYPE="swap" 
#
# if it shows standard /dev/sdxN then it's not
#
```

## Low level hardware diagnostics

For diagnosing issues affecting other types of hardware see [Hardware Troubleshooting](https://github.com/artmg/lubuild/blob/master/help/diagnose/hardware.md) 


### SMART tests 

```
gnome-disks
# highlight the drive and check in the Drive Settings menu for SMART Data and Self Tests

# if this is greyed outon External USB devices, you may need a separate utility to send
# the SMART ATA commands via the USB interface
sudo apt-get install -y smartmontools

# check that SMART is available on the device 
sudo smartctl -i /dev/sdX
# you may need the -d sat option if the drive is not in the smartctl database
# for USB device compatibility see 
# http://www.smartmontools.org/wiki/Supported_USB-Devices 

# check the health
sudo smartctl -H /dev/sdX
# if you have issues refer to http://blog.shadypixel.com/monitoring-hard-drive-health-on-linux-with-smartmontools/


# start basic tests
sudo smartctl --test=short /dev/sdX
# check results after a while
sudo smartctl -l selftest /dev/sdX

sudo smartctl --test=long /dev/sdX

sudo badblocks -v /dev/sdX
# for destructive test -wsv  
# can also store in file   -o ~/badblocks.txt
# see https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/badblocks
# you can exclude these badblocks from filesystems
# sudo e2fsck -l ~/badblocks.txt /dev/sdX

# low level erase  (move OUT to ???)
# use hdparam to set secure-erase-password then erase
# see http://askubuntu.com/a/498797

# alternatively dd with ignore errors

```

### Fault-finding in USB Mass Storage devices

If you plug in your USB drive and don't see it appear, how do you know what is wrong? 
Perhaps it might help to understand the sequence of events. 
Plug in your drive and after a few seconds use `dmesg | tail` 
to see what happened. Alternatively whilst you plug and unplug you can use 

`udevadm monitor --environment --udev` 

Here is a list of the modules and what they do / tell you...

* usb 
	- recognises new device
	- outputs ID and other info
	- if this fails, there may be an electrical connection issue
		+ re-test this using `lsusb` 
* usb-storage
	- detects Mass Storage devices
* scsi
	- accepts devices detected by usb-storage
	- recognises device
	- if this fails, there may be an issues with the controller in your USB device 
		- if so, after half a minute, you may see a usb **reset** message
* sd
	- attempts to attach scsi device (assigning /dev/sd**X**)
	- identifies layout and device options (like write protect)
	- at this point the devices should appear in `sudo fdisk -l`
	- passes on to filesystem-type-specific drivers to automount
	- if this fails, you might try to delete and recreate the partition(/s/-table) and test write and read to the device
* myfstype
	- each filesystem-type-specific driver reports what it found

Bear in mind what is mentioned about flash drives as _consumables_ in 
[https://github.com/artmg/lubuild/blob/master/help/manipulate/flash-drives-and-SSDs.md], 
that they **do** break and you might be best off buying a new drive and 
simply binning the old one (perhaps phyiscally destroyed).

Note that flash drives that appear Read Only may be repairable. 
See the above article for details. 


## Speed and Capacity tests

Capacity tests may be used when you are not sure if you can still rely
on the quoted volume of a storage device (either because it is worn out
or you fear it may be counterfeit).

Before you start to perform speed tests, you should consider how you
will be using the media. Firstly will you be reading more, or writing
more? Will it be sequential (like photos or music) or random (like
general computer use)? If you will format the drive in a particular way,
you should do this before you do your tests, if you want them to be
representative.

### built in

You can test Speed using the gnome-disk utility (Start Menu /
Preferences / Disks) to Benchmark the drive speed. Choose the partition
(where you must be prepared for data to be overwritten) and Start
Benchmark with 2 cycles of 1000 MiB with write benchmark checked.

One would expect the built-in utility to benchmark in a way which
represents typical utilisation. I'm not sure that actually IS the case.
At the time of writing the Disk utility reportedly does not take into
consideration the partition alignment considered critical to flash drive
performance.

### dd

dd is a built-in command which very quickly gives you indicative
sequential read or write statistics, and can be used for a capacity
test.

To test capacity check the correct device path and number of MiB (not
MB) in...

`sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sdX1/capacity.test bs=1M count=3500 oflag=direct conv=fdatasync`

If you write to FAT32 over 4GB you will need to write multiples of 4GB.
After to display the total size...

```
# Display in MiB
df -BM
# and in MB
df -BMB
```

### under Wine

The very popular Windows util H2testw is reported to work under Wine.

Not sure if the same goes for Crystal Disk Mark, ChkFlsh or AS SSD. Atto
and IoMeter are others commonly used under Windows.

### f3

f3 by Digirati.com.br is a cross-platform open-source solution. The author states that he based the initial programme on the process used by H2testW.

f3 is in many linux repos and may be installed on Mac using homebrew: `brew install f3`

It comprises two command line executables:

```
# perform write speed tests 
# also required to create files used by read tests
f3write /path/to/drive

# perform read speed tests
f3read /path/to/drive

# on Mac the automounted volume path is typically...
# /Volume/vol_label
```

As 'advanced' filesystems like extX reserve some capacity for internal use, 
the utility's author [recommends](https://fight-flash-fraud.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage.html#users-notes) using simple FAT volumes for testing. 

If you get just a small number of errors, 
you could try removing the files and running f3write again â€“ 
on some devices the controller recognises sectors with errors 
and maps them as such - the second time you write the errors may disappear. 

Linux users have additional commands that can speed up the process, although it will destroy any contents:

```
#identify block device name
lsblk

# refer to the drive 'sdX' rather than the partition 'sdXN'
f3probe --destructive --time-ops /dev/sdX
```

### Bonnie++

[Bonnie++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonnie%2B%2B) is a tool which
you may see being recommended by many people, despite its age. For an
intro see
[1](http://www.jamescoyle.net/how-to/599-benchmark-disk-io-with-dd-and-bonnie)

### fio

FIO seems to be the choice of many pros (and vendors). It is capable of
performing very precisely defined tests. The downside to this power and
flexibility is that I have yet to find (or work out for myself) a FIO
configuration file which will simulate typical ubuntu desktop user.
Perhaps I could convert [a sample file for simulating
servers](https://www.linux.com/learn/tutorials/442451-inspecting-disk-io-performance-with-fio/)?
