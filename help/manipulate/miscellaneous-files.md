The first section of this looks at manipulating files and folders in general. 
This includes sychronisation, deduplicating and bulk renaming

Then further down there are ways to inspect miscellaneous types of file, such as emails, or binaries


# Working with files and folders

## Bulk rename based on metadata

Although some file managers in Windows, Macos and Linux flavours can do some bulk renaming, 
they do not always allow the names to be based on the metadata describing the contents. 
Use cases for this include sorting photos easily by the date they were taken, 
or grouping music into albums and artists. 


### GUI tool

The requirement is for a tool that is:

* easy to use with a graphical user interface (GUI) 
* open source, and preferably an active project with multiple developers
* can use both EXIF image metadata and ID3 music metadata
* available across platforms (at least Macos, Ubuntu and Windows)
* uses reasonably lightweight and efficient subsystems

* MÃ©tamorphose 2
    * open source, cross platform and multiple contributor
    * replaced previous Metamorphose project
    * based on python and Qt
    * not many contributions recently
    * PPA way out of date and no Macos binary (needs make-ing)
* Inviska rename
    * open source and cross-platform, using Qt
    * sole developer, site was out for a few months
    * code published but only as zips
    * fully-featured across all platforms
* Ant Renamer
    * seems like a solo project where code is published
    * written using Borland Delphi
    * unicode support only on Windows
* F2Utility
    * cross-platform
    * java-based
* ExifRenamer
    * Macos only
    * free not libre
* Exif ReName
    * not macos

### command line using exiftool

exiftool is commonly available through standard application repositories on linux variants
via homebrew core and as a windows download

Here is an example for the use case 
to rename all files in a folder to "YYYYmmdd_HHMMSS.ext" 
based on the date and time that the photo was taken (metadata)

```
# show the metadata for a single file
exiftool myPhoto.jpg
# help - http://www.sno.phy.queensu.ca/~phil/exiftool/
# show the shortnames for meta tags
exiftool -s myPhoto.jpg

# rename to "YYYYmmdd_HHMMSS.ext" and move into folder "renamed"
exiftool "-FileName<DateTimeOriginal" -d "%Y%m%d_%H%M%S.%%e" -directory=renamed .
```



## File and Folder syncronisation

Rather than clients for synchronising content to and from specific cloud file storage services, 
these focus on accessing your own local or internal resources. 

### rsync

credit > https://help.ubuntu.com/community/rsync
is on ubuntu by default
for remote files use SSH, unless samba share on private network is mounted

rsync -a source --delete destination

--delete is like /purge

#### two way rsync

```
rsync -avuz source/ dest/
rsync -avuz dest/ source/
# credit [http://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/showthread.php?p=2899735#post2899735]
```

#### grsync

graphical interface


### unison

* Windows & Linux gui tool written in Objective CAML
* Discontinued
* [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unison_(file_synchronizer)]
* Allows sync chains in various topolgies, see > http://sunoano.name/ws/public_xhtml/unison.html


### Conduit

GNOME sync app with plugins for files, photos, emails, PIMs, and many online services
help > http://live.gnome.org/Conduit/Documentation/UserDocumentation


### open source tools

#### code ideas

Synchrorep http://www.iceberg.0rg.fr/ is Python based and supports ftp, samba & ssh mounted shares
Conduit http://live.gnome.org/Conduit/Development is Python based with many customm data providers

###arch ideas###

GNU usbsync http://klingspor-thueringen.de/usbsync/ uses file in root to automatically sync USBs with multiple PCs

## Differences between Files and Folders 

If you have two instances of any of the following:

* a file, 
* a group of files, 
* a folder tree, 

and want to look beyond the similarities to find the differences. 

These may help you syncronise or deduplicate, 
but the focus here is on finding what is not identical. 

### Candidates

* GUI
	* meld
		* currently installed candidate 
			* [https://github.com/artmg/lubuild/blob/master/app-installs.bash]
	* xxdiff
	* kdiff3 (floss) Win/Nux - [http://askubuntu.com/questions/312604/how-do-i-install-xxdiff-in-13-04] 
	* diffMerge (free) Win/Nux 
* CLI
	* diff
		* usually installed in distros
	* 

### diff examples

```
# basic diff (show what the differences are)
diff file1 file2
# side-by-side
diff -y file1 file2
# quiet diff (just tell me if they are different)
diff file1 file2
```



## Deduplicate files and folders

As files get copied around, you are sometimes left with multiple copies. 
Some of these might be similar but different versions. 
How do you sort this all out? 

Relates to apps mentioned above for Differences between Files and Folders, 
but this is where you need to find the similar ones first! 


### Requirements ###

M  run on Ubuntu and derivatives
S  be provided in standard repos
M  Scan a folder
C  Scan multiple folders
M  Identify files which have identical content
S  quick scan to target files by name, date and size
C  date scan allow hour offset for time-zone issues 
C  interpret special file types (e..g. ZIP cabinets or Media files) to identify identical or similar content, showing differences (e.g. photo metadata)
M  list duplicates grouped, with folder information
S  have GUI to allow the user to choose which to remove

Note that this is related to, but NOT the same as,  
identifing the differences between files and/or folders


### Candidates ###

find more at http://askubuntu.com/a/118389


#### GUI 

* fslint
    * [http://www.pixelbeat.org/fslint]
    * in repos

    * based on filesize only? (shows date) - how to check contents?
    * can't view by folder
        * can only "select all in same folder"

* dupeguru
    * [http://www.hardcoded.net/dupeguru/]
    * based on Python 3 with Qt GUI
    * requires PPA
        * **not available for every release**
