## Empty folders

### Extract files from folder structure

# I wanted to find and move files including relative path
# which you could do with find, see - https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/59159
# but the alternative rysnc seemed neater
#     archive  ignore empty       move not copy
rsync -av --prune-empty-dirs --remove-source-files Source/ Target/


### delete empty folders in tree

#Â a much simpler approach if you can accept deletion
find . -type d -empty -delete

## Loop through list of pathnames

# These are meant to be used interactively

### and output num files dirs and datasize

## take multiple named files

### concatenate files removing headers

# If there are multiple table files (e.g. CSVs) 
# and you want to concatenate them into one single table
# removing headers from all but the first
# then you can simply add the first line from any
