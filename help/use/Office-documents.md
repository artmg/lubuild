This article covers using generic Office documents, including 
word processing and spreadsheets. It assumes that you use the 
LibreOffice applications on your linux builds. 
However some topics may also cover other popular office software. 

There is also a section on the related topic of 
Desktop Publishing (DTP) software. 
It also touches on managing contacts and events.

### Installing fonts

You can also double-click on the font file (or select Open with Font Viewer in the right-click menu). 
Then click the Install Font button.

```
# rebuild Font Cache
sudo fc-cache -f -v
```

* Ubuntu has the GTK `font-manager` package

## Interoperability

### Microsoft Windows and Office

#### Fonts 

The basic fonts are installed as part of [https://github.com/artmg/lubuild/blob/master/app-installs.bash]

This include msttcorefonts and the 
Google metric-equivalent fonts for Calibri and Cambrian

These latter allow you to see documents made using these Microsoft proprietary fonts 
with more or less the correct layout as you would if you had them installed.
credit [https://wiki.debian.org/SubstitutingCalibriAndCambriaFonts]

The community is asking LibreOffice to install these by default in future 
[https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/libreoffice/+bug/1612114]
and LibreOffice team is looking at ways to improve the experience
[https://design.blog.documentfoundation.org/2016/10/21/dealing-with-missing-fonts/]

##### Selecting uninstalled Fonts

Please note that LibreOffice will NOT currently allow you to choose a Font that is not installed. 

The workaround suggested by the Debian team is to start with a template where Styles have already 
been set up on a Windows machine with Office and these Fonts installed. 
[https://wiki.debian.org/SubstitutingCalibriAndCambriaFonts#Drawback]

##### Embedding Fonts

Since LibreOffice 4, you have the option to embed fonts in your document, 
to ensure that the recipient will see it as you do, 
even if they don't have the Fonts installed on their own PC. 

Simply open **File / Properties / Font** and check `Embed Fonts in the document` 

However as of 5.2 the filesize may be incredibly large, as it chooses to embed 
any fonts referenced by any Style in the document, rather than whether or not the 
Style and / or Font is actually USED in the document as saved. 

This issue is being tracked as [https://bugs.documentfoundation.org/show_bug.cgi?id=65353] 
and the following two questions about how to work around the issue were unanswered: 
[https://ask.libreoffice.org/en/question/69433/how-do-i-remove-unused-embedded-fonts/] 
[https://ask.libreoffice.org/en/question/44689/how-to-cleanup-unused-embedded-fonts-from-odt-or-garbage-collect-inside-odt-file/] 

###### Workaround

If you manually open the ODT file with an Archive Manager, you will see the files 
in the folder **Fonts**. To know which is which view the file `content.xml`, 
to see the `<office:font-face-decls>` entries. 

Although you can delete the files from the Fonts folder using an Archive Manager, 
just doing that will provoke an error trying to open the document. 
You must also remove the `<office:font-face-decls>` entries, 
and possibly also remove the file entries from `META-INF/manifest.xml`.

###### Solution?

If you can't wait for the bug to be fixed, or you had to clean up a lot of files, 
you could develop a partially automated solution. You can use one of the 
[many libraries for editing ODF files](http://opendocumentformat.org/developers/) 
(see this [phython sample for replacing images](http://recipes.opendocsociety.org/recipes/swapping-old-new-image-from-documents-cli)). 

For testing around Font Embedding in ODF files, see also 
[http://plugtest.opendocsociety.org/doku.php?id=scenarios:20120419:fontembedding&s%5B%5D=embed]

Note that, if you want to create a PDF with embedded fonts, you are likely to get 
a more efficient (smaller) filesize if you export to PDF from LibreOffice than 
if you use a PDF Print Driver such as those based on ghostscript. 

For more about working with fonts in PDFs see 
[https://github.com/artmg/lubuild/blob/master/help/manipulate/PDF-files.md]


### Apple Mac

#### .pages files

As of LibreOffice 5.0 there is support for some (older?) Mac word-processor file formats. 

If you are struggling to deal with a **.pages** file from a Mac user with iWork Pages, 
you have a couple of last ditch options:
* sign up to iCloud to use Apple's own convertor to render a DOC or PDF
* Open the archive cabinet, look for the _QuickLook_ folder and check out the _Preview.PDF_ inside


## Interchange formats

These cover the many standards and common formats 
for exchanging information, 
especially with common entities like 
contacts, events, messages. 
They include simple file formats like vCard 
and APIs like CardDAV.

### table to virtual card

Contact or event data is often held in table format, 
especially in spreadsheet software. 
A common exchange format, especially with mobile 
is vCard. 
This problem / solution is a
superset of 'convert csv to vcard'

## Desktop Publishing (DTP) software

Although combined office suites like LibreOffice do allow you to do some publishing work, 
some of the features of Writer or Draw may be hard to use or just not quite allow you to 
manipulate documents and lay them out the way you want. 

Here we assume you want to produce some kind of multi-page newsletter that is 
visually both appealing and coherent. 

The main candidate that comes up again and again is **Scribus**, 
but others are covered in the section further below. 
For other software more related to graphical manipulation that multipage styling, 
like Gimp or Inkscape, see [https://github.com/artmg/lubuild/blob/master/help/manipulate/photos-and-images.md]


### Scribus

Scribus is in the official Ubuntu repos, and is a reasonably well-developed program 
for the advanced layout of documents. 

You should bear in mind that Scribus looks at documents from a different perspective than 
LibreOffice Writer and other word-processors. The focus in Writer is the content and structure, 
then you can use Styles and Page Layout to make it look better on the page. Scribus on the other hand 
starts from the overall Page Layout, then allows you to fill it with content, styling it the way you want. 

`sudo apt-get install scribus`


#### Getting Started

There is a wiki covering many of the features but if you look on YouTube 
you'll find some handy intros for total newbies. 
Kevin Pugh has a useful series of short intros to get you familiar with the interface 
[https://www.youtube.com/user/HumpyCreature007] 

You can just pick up one of the Templates as a starting point. However, if you want to 
control your layout accurately and easily, you should follow a simple but effective 
set of steps that make a pragmatic workflow 
[http://www.ocsmag.com/2015/11/12/the-art-of-layout-according-to-scribus-i-master-pages/]


#### Functionality and features

Admittedly it lacks some features compared with commercial packages, 
but there is a lot of development going on, so keep your eye on the development 
candidates for bleeding-edge features [https://launchpad.net/~scribus/+archive/ubuntu/ppa] 
either with the **scribus-ng** (more stable) or **scribus-trunk** (daily build from head).

```
sudo add-apt-repository -y ppa:scribus/ppa
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y scribus-ng
```

### Other Candidates

Software _mentioned_ by others, but not reviewed in depth here includes:

* Laidout
    * principally aimed at Impositioning, e.g. folding and cutting into booklets
    * can handle images, gradient fills, paths, meshes and warping
    * not really big on text
* LyX
    * non-WYSIWYG front-end to LaTeX typesetting system
* 

Other related software includes:

* gLabels
    * use printing labels to repeat designs many times across a single sheet

Discounted as not Free Open Source Software (FOSS):

* Pagestream
