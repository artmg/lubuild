## C++

### learning resources

* simple tutorial
	[http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/]
* fun problems to solve
	* these could be solved using any language, 
		* but maybe C++ makes you think more, as it is lower-level
	* a handful of mainly simple problems

### cross platform c++ console ide

The requirement is for a free / libre C++ IDE that allows 
programs to be both written on and compiled for 
both Windows and Linux systems. 
Ideally the solution should be reasonably lightweight, 
and allow for simple, standard C++ syntax code 
that will run on a console. 

The chosen candidate here is **Code::Blocks**, 
although CodeLite is probably another close contender. 
Eclipse with the C++ plugin would have worked, albeit with more bulk, 
and Qt Creator was only discounted as the console code 
was not classic C++ style. 

See [#purpose-built-ides] section below for more details on alternatives. 

```
# install `codeblocks` package, and all dependencies, from ubuntu repos 
sudo apt-get install codeblocks g++
# since ubuntu 17.04 the codeblocks version is reasonably recent
# NB on fresh install all the compiler/debug/widgets might take 700MB!
```

* for Windows pick installer that includes MinGW compiler

### reusing common functions

If you want to use common functions you have written 
from multiple programs, you can create a functions source file (.cpp) 
and declare them in a header (.hpp) that you can #include from your code 
and add your include path into the compiler settings

* introduction to principles [http://www.cplusplus.com/forum/beginner/79689/#msg429444]
* avoiding nesting of headers [https://stackoverflow.com/a/23163775]
* in depth explanation of headers [http://www.cplusplus.com/forum/articles/10627/]

Note that all functions in your included headers are usually compiled 
into the executable, even if your code did not actually call them. 


## Java

One solution for cross-platform programming is to use the 
Java Runtime Environment (JRE), compiling code into .JAR files 
that will work on any platform where a JRE is installed

* Oracle JDK
	* The Java Development Kit (JDK) is for coders to develop Java programs
	* it includes a JRE for running the programs
	* closer implementation to the original reference Sun Java
	* sometimes more compatible with apps than OpenJRE / OpenJDK
	* if you want the 'Java EE JDK' you still need the basic Java SE JDK first
		* the EE components that go on top is now called GlassFish
	* to use Oracle Java on Ubuntu see [https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Java]
* Eclipse IDE
	* perhaps a little heavyweight but very comprehensive and commonly used
	* Use Help / Install Software to add the following plugins...
* JavaFX
	* this is the latest 'widget' system for Oracle Java
		* allows you to build graphical user interface (GUI) windows for apps
	* use SceneBuilder to create the GUIs
	* works well with MVC (Model View Controller) architectural pattern
* EGIT
	* plugin for Project / Team / Share to work with GitHub and other git repos


## Python

Popular with Data Scientists, school kids and many hobbyist projects (perhaps due to its low barriers to entry) Python is an increasingly common choice of language outside of specialist niches. Its continued development is supported by partners around the world and from among the largest technology companies. 

On the off chance it is not already installed by something else:

```
sudo apt install python3
```

A common choice of IDE is IDLE:

```
sudo apt install idle3
```

although print commands are not handled that efficiently at runtime.


## IDEs

### code editors

This section is focused on free/libre code editors that run using Qt widgets

If you simply want markdown-specific editors for richer text formatting see https://github.com/artmg/lubuild/blob/master/help/use/markdown.md


* Previously using Geany as lightweight IDE
	* edit and execute Shell scripts
	* also use as general editor for markdown text
* want to consider qt-based alternative
	* for smaller footprint when moving to LxQt desktop
	* syntax highlighting

* JuffEd
	* Qt, C++, with QScintilla library
	* current editor for Lubuntu Next / LxQt
	* reasonable syntax highlighting
		* not currently including markdown
	* can it launch execute in shell?
	* juffed-plugins package also in repos
	* not loads of development in last few years, but some PRs accepted
* Tea
	* lightweight
	* still under development at July 2017
	* odd paradigm, almost wants to be a file and personal manager too
	* supports markdown and shell with an execute button
* Notepadqq
	* requires ppa:notepadqq-team/notepadqq
	* most active in 2015 but still some commits
* neovim-qt
	* c++, qt
	* in repos
	* some depends, including neovim which adds python libs
	* but it's just a GUI version of vim
* Kate
	* depends on KDE libraries
* QVim
	* Qt port of GVim
	* lots of plugins
* QSciTE 
* FeatherPad?


### Fully cross-platform, open source

This section looks at more richly featured Text Editors
(think Notepad++) that are supported on Linux, Windows and Mac. Also those that are fully open-sourced.

* Bluefish
	* mature and current project with multiple devs
	* may require GTK
* Howl
	* relatively new
* Atom
	* heavywight, needs Electron
* Brackets
	* only focussed on web-development 


Using the mature and popular python-based `neovim` APIs 
there are also:

* gonvim
	* go language and qt
	* builds available for Windows, Macos, Linux
	* quite new and only a few releases so far
* neovim-qt
	* self-compile, not sure if this has ready builds
* Oni
	* uses nodeJS, yarn (code package mgr), python
	* may also use electron



### purpose built IDEs

This section is focused on free/libre IDEs that run using Qt widgets

* Eric Python IDE
	* built on Qt toolkit (seems to be coded in python)
	* Languages: Python and Ruby
		* with shells and debuggers
	* Scintilla integrated
	* task manager
* MonkeyStudio
	* Qt and C++
	* 22 languages (also uses QScintilla)
	* mature but not much recent development
* KDevelop
	* C++ and Qt
	* part of KDE project
	* supports plugins
* QtCreator
	* the IDE built by the developers of Qt
	* originally planned to be lightweight
* BabyDevelop
	* written in Qt / C++
	* small footprint
	* focus is on developing C++
	* no movement since 2014

* Not qt: 
	* CodeLite
		* written in C++ with GTK2
		* for code including C++
		* add-on (paid?) for WxWidgets
		* includes plugins for git
		* is it limited to GDB for debugging?
		* Windows, Linux and Macos
	* CodeBlocks
		* written in C++ with wxWidgets
		* accepts a variety of compilers
		* mature project but not many updates recently
		* lightweight and easy for beginners to get started
		* GitBlocks plugin not complete (Aug'17)
		* GDB debugging on Windows had problems but should be sorted
	* atom
		* runs on electron framework (web-oriented)
		* good markdown integration
		* developed by github
		* HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and Node.js integration
	* Bluefish
		* uses GTK+ toolkit
		* no markdown
	* Light Table
		* different paradigm to most IDEs
		* not sure about performance or dependencies
	* Komodo Edit
		* rich and mature IDE project
		* based on Mozilla platform

* Not free/libre
	* sublime text 
		* is it still under development?
		* is a package available?


## Other languages

* Basic
	* Gambas3 (use PPA)
